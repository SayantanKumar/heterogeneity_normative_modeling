## Abstract

**INTRODUCTION**: Previous studies have applied normative modeling on a single neuroimaging modality to investigate Alzheimer Disease (AD) heterogeneity. We employed a deep learning-based multimodal normative framework to analyze individual-level variation across ATN (amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration) imaging biomarkers.

**METHODS**: We selected cross-sectional discovery (n = 665) and replication cohorts (n = 430) with available T1-weighted MRI, amyloid and tau PET. Normative modeling estimated individual-level abnormal deviations in amyloid-positive individuals compared to amyloid-negative controls. Regional abnormality patterns were mapped at different clinical group levels to assess intra-group heterogeneity. An individual-level disease severity index (DSI) was calculated using both the spatial extent and magnitude of abnormal deviations across ATN.

**RESULTS**: Greater intra-group heterogeneity in ATN abnormality patterns was observed in more severe clinical stages of AD. Higher DSI was associated with worse cognitive function and increased risk of disease progression.

**DISCUSSION**: Subject-specific abnormality maps across ATN reveal the heterogeneous impact of AD on the brain.

## Environment & Packages

We recommend an environment with python >= 3.7 and pytorch >= 1.10.2, and then install the following dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Cortical and subcortical brain atlases were visualized using the ggseg package. The original R implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ggseg/ggseg). A more recent Python implementation can also be found [here](https://github.com/ggseg/python-ggseg).

## Datasets & Feature extraction

### Datasets

Our analysis included a discovery dataset consisting of individuals from ADNI and a replication dataset consisting of individuals from Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Research Center (ADRC) dataset at Washington University in St. Louis.

ADNI data used in this study are publicly available and can be requested following ADNI Data Sharing and Publications Committee guidelines: [https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/). Knight ADRC data can be obtained by submitting a data request through [https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/data-request-form/](https://knightadrc.wustl.edu/data-request-form/).
